## Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I"m Shant!

I'm a full-stack software engineer with 6+ years of experience delivering scalable, user-centered web applications in international, cross functional teams. I enjoy wearing many hats - whether it's building user facing frontend apps or reliable backends. I thrive with full ownership of the stack and contributing across the entire product lifecycle. 

- I'm currently working on a collaborative digital authoring platform to help institutions and educators in creating interactive STEM content.
